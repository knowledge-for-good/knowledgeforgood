# Knowledge For Good
Working towards a future where knowledge is accessible to everyone, for all time, everywhere.

## Our GitHub Repo
Here is where we focus, organize, and communicate, in as transparant a way as possible*. We think GitHub is great as our project hub because:
- We can create "webs of knowledge" simply with bi-directional linking.
- No information is lost with GitHub's auto-saving history of all edits.
- We maintain a coherent "single source of truth" with issues and dicussions located here.

## Our Links
- [Our YouTube channel](#): We post workshop and meeting recordings here.
- [Our brainstorming sessions](#): We often make mindmaps on Coggle.it
- Our design documents: We like to jam visually on [Figma](#) and [Miro](#)

## Our Workshops
- Intro to Clojure & GitHub for Open Source Contribution, facilitated by @avidrucker  
- Intro to Liberating Stuctures, facilitated by @seekanddefine
- (working title) Data Analytics, Digital Literacy, Responsibility in Digital Knowledge Stewardship

## Our Values
- Growth & health
- Mindfulness & accountability
- Do no harm
- Truth & honesty
- Love & compassion
- Integrity & accessibility (& continually striving towards them)
