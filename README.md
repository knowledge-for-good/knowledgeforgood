# Knowledge For Good

Working towards a future where knowledge is accessible to everyone, for all time, everywhere.

_**May today's thoughts, words, and movements be offered with love, kindness, and compassion.**_

_**May we connect to ourselves and to one another, all for the better.**_

We want to help people learn. We do research, we bring people together, we make tools, we teach, we discuss, and we have fun.

So far (July 2021), we have taught two workshops, and released one 30 day learning challenge.

## Our GitHub Repo

Here is where we focus, organize, and communicate, in as transparant a way as possible\*. We think GitHub is great as our project hub because:

*   We can create "webs of knowledge" simply with bi-directional linking.
*   No information is lost with GitHub's auto-saving history of all edits.
*   We maintain a coherent "single source of truth" with issues and dicussions located here.

## Our Links

*   [Our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkynv82S4xOnQsdQRlOELoQ): We post workshop and meeting recordings here.
*   [Our brainstorming sessions](#): We often make mindmaps on Coggle.it
*   Our design documents: We like to jam visually on [Figma](#) and [Miro](#)
