# Knowledge For Good
Working towards a future where knowledge is accessible to everyone, for all time, everywhere.

## Our GitHub Repo
Here is where we focus, organize, and communicate, in as transparant a way as possible*. Because GitHub allows for bi-directional linking, we can create "webs of knowledge" simply. Because GitHub keeps a history of all edits to repositories, no information is lost. Because we use this repository with issues and dicussions, we maintain a coherent "single source of truth".
