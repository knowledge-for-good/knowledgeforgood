## Overview

The Future of Education Glossary is a freely-licensed, open source lexicon of terms related to education, technology, and human development. It is currently a collection terms I am learning as I do research. My hope is others will join me and it will become a collaborative process. The goal of this glossary is to be a useful resource for the emtore education community including but not limited to learners, children, parents, educators, teachers, and anyone interested in reimagining education. The glossary itself is currently maintained by Knowledge for Good.
