1. Determine at the beginning of meeting/workshop who will record.
2. Determine how notes will be saved. Default to saving in a source that doesn't disappear (meeting chat disappears).
3. Record video using recording software (we are still figuring out what tool we prefer for this)
   - OBS-Free and Opensource
   - Zoom-Free options (this is what Avi uses right now)
   - Loom-Free options
   - Wondershare DemoCreator
4. Save video (to where is still an open question, such as local only, Dropbox, other, etc.)
   - for now, local only is what we are doing
5. Upload to [our shared KFG YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkynv82S4xOnQsdQRlOELoQ)
